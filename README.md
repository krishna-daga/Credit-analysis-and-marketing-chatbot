Problem Statement: Developing a Generative AI powered Chatbot for Credit Analysis and Marketing

Objective: Design and develop a chatbot utilizing Generative AI (Gen AI) for:

1. Credit Approval Assistance: Analyze a user's creditworthiness and predict approval likelihood.

2. Personalized Marketing: Generate targeted marketing emails based on user data and credit score.

Challenges:

§ E.g.: Can we disburse a loan to Vikas?

o Integrate with a secure database to retrieve user information (excluding sensitive data like full credit report).

§ Have a SQL lite or some RDBMS data with user information like DOB, AGE, Bank Balance etc.. relevant to calculate credit scores

2. Credit Approval Analysis:

o Develop an AI model trained on historical credit data to predict loan approval probability. (Take data set from Kaggle)

o Ensure the model is:

§ Fair and unbiased: Mitigate potential bias in the training data to avoid discriminatory outcomes.

3. Marketing Email Generation:

o Design a system that leverages user data and predicted approval likelihood to:

§ Segment users into relevant marketing groups.

§ Utilize Gen AI to create personalized email content with targeted offers and messaging.

Technical Requirements:
