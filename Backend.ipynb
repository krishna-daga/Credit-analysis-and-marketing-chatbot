    "    ## Guidelines for Query Generation:\n",
    "    1. If the user specifies a specific number of examples to obtain, limit the query results using the `LIMIT` clause.\n",
    "    2. Use only the column names from the provided database schema (see below). Avoid querying non-existent columns.\n",

    "    4. Do query for all the columns if not specified or else query the relevant columns and the name column.\n",
